Design Principles:

Modern, clean, professional aesthetic
Responsive design (desktop-first, but mobile-friendly)
Loading skeletons for async content
Error boundaries with helpful messages
Toast notifications for actions (success/error)
Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
Empty states with CTAs
Consistent spacing and typography
Dark mode support (optional but nice to have)
Key UI Patterns:

Modal dialogs for forms (create/edit)
Dropdown menus for action buttons
Tabs for organized content sections
Pagination with page size options
Debounced search inputs
Sortable table headers
Collapsible sidebar
Context menus (right-click actions)
Keyboard shortcuts (optional)
5. Media Library Detailed Specs
Upload Flow:

Click "Upload" button or drag files to drop zone
Select destination folder from dropdown
Choose multiple files
Show upload progress for each file (progress bar)
Auto-generate thumbnails for images (canvas API)
Validate file types and sizes
Show success/error for each upload
Auto-refresh the current folder view
File Operations:

View file details in side panel
Download file (blob URL)
Delete single or multiple files
Move files to another folder (modal with folder tree)
Copy storage_key or full URL to clipboard
Replace file while keeping same ID
Rename file

Folder Operations:

Create subfolder (modal input)
Rename folder (inline edit or modal)
Delete folder (with confirmation, show file count)
Move folder to different parent (drag & drop or modal)
Calculate and display folder size recursively
Show file count badge

6. Mock Data & API Layer
API Service Structure:
typescript// src/services/api.ts
export const api = {
  users: {
    getAll: (filters?: UserFilters) => Promise<User[]>,
    getById: (id: string) => Promise<User>,
    create: (data: CreateUserDto) => Promise<User>,
    update: (id: string, data: UpdateUserDto) => Promise<User>,
    delete: (id: string) => Promise<void>,
  },
  media: {
    getFolders: () => Promise<Folder[]>,
    getAssets: (folderId?: string) => Promise<MediaAsset[]>,
    createFolder: (data: CreateFolderDto) => Promise<Folder>,
    uploadAssets: (formData: FormData) => Promise<MediaAsset[]>,
    deleteAsset: (id: string) => Promise<void>,
    moveAssets: (ids: string[], folderId: string) => Promise<void>,
  },
  lessons: {
    getAll: (filters?: LessonFilters) => Promise<Lesson[]>,
    getById: (id: string) => Promise<Lesson>,
    create: (data: CreateLessonDto) => Promise<Lesson>,
    update: (id: string, data: UpdateLessonDto) => Promise<Lesson>,
    publish: (id: string) => Promise<Lesson>,
  },
  // ... more endpoints
};

// Mock with setTimeout for async simulation
const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
Generate Realistic Mock Data:

Use faker or manual realistic data
Maintain referential integrity (foreign keys)
Include edge cases (empty folders, very long names, etc.)
Provide at least 50+ users, 20+ lessons, 100+ media assets

7. Form Handling
React Hook Form + Zod Example:
typescriptconst lessonSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(3, 'Title must be at least 3 characters'),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  topic_id: z.string().uuid(),
  level_id: z.string().uuid(),
  is_published: z.boolean().default(false),
});

type LessonFormData = z.infer<typeof lessonSchema>;

function LessonForm() {
  const form = useForm<LessonFormData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(lessonSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      title: '',
      description: '',
      is_published: false,
    },
  });

  const { mutate, isLoading } = useCreateLesson();

  const onSubmit = (data: LessonFormData) => {
    mutate(data);
  };

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        {/* Form fields */}
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
}

üìù Technical Notes

No localStorage - all state managed in memory or with TanStack Query cache
Use TypeScript strict mode
Proper error boundaries around major sections
Accessible components (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
Code splitting considerations (keep in single artifact but organize well)
Reusable components in separate sections
Proper loading states and optimistic updates
