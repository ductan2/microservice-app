    # Logic: Get progress events for user with filters
    # - Query progress_events by user_id
    # - Apply type filter if provided
    # - Apply date range filters if provided
    # - Order by created_at DESC
    # - Apply pagination (limit, offset)
    # - Return list of event records
    
    # get_event(event_id: int) -> Optional[ProgressEvent]
    # Logic: Get specific event by ID
    # - Query progress_events by id
    # - Return event object or None
    
    # create_event(user_id: UUID, event_type: str, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> ProgressEvent
    # Logic: Create new progress event
    # - Validate event_type (should be one of predefined types)
    # - Event types include:
    #   - 'lesson_started': {lesson_id, started_at}
    #   - 'lesson_completed': {lesson_id, score, completed_at}
    #   - 'quiz_started': {quiz_id, attempt_no}

    #   - 'streak_updated': {current_len, longest_len}
    #   - 'achievement_unlocked': {achievement_id, achievement_name}
    # - Create progress_event record with:
    #   - user_id
    #   - type = event_type
    #   - payload = JSONB payload data
    #   - created_at = current timestamp
    # - Insert into database and commit
    # - Optionally: publish event to message queue for other services
    # - Return created event record
    
    # get_events_by_type(user_id: UUID, event_type: str, limit: int = 50, offset: int = 0) -> List[ProgressEvent]
    # Logic: Get events of specific type for user
    # - Query progress_events by user_id and type
    # - Order by created_at DESC
    # - Apply pagination
    # - Return filtered list
    
    # get_recent_events(user_id: UUID, limit: int = 50) -> List[ProgressEvent]
    # Logic: Get recent events for activity feed
    # - Query progress_events by user_id
    # - Order by created_at DESC
    # - Limit to specified number
    # - Return recent events for user dashboard
    
    # delete_event(event_id: int) -> bool
    # Logic: Delete progress event
    # - Find and delete progress_event record
    # - Commit transaction
    # - Return True if successful
    
    # get_event_type_stats(date_from: Optional[date] = None, date_to: Optional[date] = None) -> Dict[str, int]
    # Logic: Get statistics of event types
    # - Query progress_events with optional date filters
    # - Group by type
    # - Count events per type
    # - Return dict: {event_type: count}
    
    # get_user_event_timeline(user_id: UUID, date_from: date, date_to: date) -> List[ProgressEvent]
    # Logic: Get all events in date range for timeline view
    # - Query progress_events by user_id and date range
    # - Order by created_at ASC (chronological)
    # - Return ordered list for timeline visualization
    
    # bulk_create_events(events: List[Dict]) -> List[ProgressEvent]
    # Logic: Create multiple events at once
    # - For each event dict:
    #   - Create ProgressEvent object
    #   - Validate user_id, type, payload
    #   - Set created_at
    # - Bulk insert all events
    # - Commit transaction
    # - Return list of created events
    
    # get_event_count_by_day(user_id: UUID, days: int = 30) -> Dict[date, int]
    # Logic: Get daily event counts for user
    # - Calculate date range (last N days)
    # - Query progress_events for user in range
    # - Group by date (cast created_at to date)
    # - Count events per day
    # - Return dict: {date: event_count}
    
    # publish_event_to_queue(event: ProgressEvent) -> bool
    # Logic: Publish event to message queue for other services
    # - Convert event to message format
    # - Publish to RabbitMQ exchange/topic
    # - Other services (notification, analytics) can consume
    # - Return True if successful
    # - This enables event-driven architecture
